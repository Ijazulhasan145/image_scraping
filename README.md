📌 Real-Time Satellite Image Scraping & Classification

🚀 Project Overview:

This project focuses on automated real-time satellite image scraping and deep learning-based land classification using GPS coordinates. It enables large-scale satellite data collection and AI-driven analysis to classify land types such as Water, Desert, Industrial, Barren, and Crop.

📍 Key Features

✅ Automated Satellite Image Scraping

🔹 Uses Selenium WebDriver to extract real-time satellite images from Google Earth.

🔹 Dynamically inputs GPS coordinates and captures high-resolution images.

🔹 Automated zoom adjustment for optimal image clarity.

🔹 Efficient batch processing of images for large-scale data collection.

✅ Deep Learning-Based Land Classification

🔹 Utilizes ResNet-based CNN model for land type prediction.

🔹 Processes Landsat 8 OLI Tier 1 dataset for training.

🔹 Predicts land coverage percentages for Water, Desert, Industrial, Barren, and Crop areas.

🔹 Designed for real-time geospatial intelligence applications.

✅ Scalable & Open-Source Solution

🔹 Automated GPS-based coordinate generation for any region.

🔹 Easily integrates into web applications for real-time land classification.

🔹 Modular architecture to allow further enhancements.
